              The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even time can
              end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First Flame, a
              mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat and cold, or life
              and death.
            </p>

          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4 ">
            <p class="fondo-gris">
              As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as life and death having little
              distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of Dark, the time when the First Flame has
              fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath, time, space, and reality breaking down, lands
              collapsing and converging on one another, people mutating into monsters, darkness covering the world, and
              the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must
              "link" themselves to the First Flame, becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First
              Flame will eventually die, and an Age of Dark will begin.
